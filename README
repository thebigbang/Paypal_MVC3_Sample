Paypal MVC3 Sample is a simple mvc3 application showing how to use paypal into it.

It manage a shopping cart, express paypal checkout, but not the shortcut version yet (while the code about it is written it is not mvc compliant yet so comented).

To be able to try it you will need a paypal developper account, and some paypals tests account.

You will need to provide in paypalfunctions.cs your paypal developpers credentials and API.
